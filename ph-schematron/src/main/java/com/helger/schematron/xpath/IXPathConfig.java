 * This is a counter-measure against
 * <a href="https://github.com/phax/ph-schematron/issues/96">#96</a>: When using
 * Saxon-HE, you have stripped down XPath support (no XPath higher order
 * functions according to the <a href=
 * "https://www.saxonica.com/html/products/feature-matrix-9-9.html">saxon
 * feature matrix</a>). In this case, you perhaps want to use a different
 * <em>XPath implementation</em> (most commonly the XPath implementation shipped
